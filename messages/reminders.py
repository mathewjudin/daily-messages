Reminders depending on the day of the week

monday_msg = ["I hope you planned this week on Friday evening itself. If not, please do it now. Send out all the calendar events that you need to for this week. Accept (or reject) the calendar invites you received. Know at least two of your top priorities.", "I hope you planned this week on Friday evening itself. If not, please do it now. Planning your week in advance will help you say NO and help you from having to constantly firefight."]
tuesday_msg = ["Keep daily notes of what went good/bad, the folks that you gave or recieved help from and the new tech you (leanrt + applied). It will help on Friday when you fill out your retrospective and help survey", "You should be trying to read new stuff every day. It is ok if you cannot apply the concepts right away or even if you cannot grasp the ideas right away. Overtime, the exposure you gain from reading will be worth much more than the few minutes you spend everyday."]
wednesday_msg = ["As you go about this week, be on the lookout for how you can help a colleague get better. The help does not have to be substantial or life-changing or even correct! Just your attempt to help someone who is stuck will make Qxf2 suck a little less.", "You should pay attention to the work of your colleagues, at least at a high level. Read through Trello once or twice a week even if you are working on a client. Be curious about what your colleagues do at clients even if you are on R&D."]
thursday_msg = ["Make an effort to share what you learn. Almost all the material on the Internet that you use to unblock yourself was created by busy professionals like you. So, once in a while, take a pause from consuming all that good stuff and try to share your own learnings", "You are expected to share what you know on our blog. If you feel unqualified, remember that technical expertise is a spectrum. There is always someone who will find your perspective useful."]
friday_msg = ["Please fill out the help survey and retrospective card! Both habits are defenses to preserve the habit of remote work. <a href='http://34.205.45.167/survey'>Link to survey</a>", "Have you filled out the retrospective card? Have you filled out the survey? <a href='http://34.205.45.167/survey'>Link to survey</a>", "Please remember to fill out the retrospective card and the survey! <a href='http://34.205.45.167/survey'>Link to survey</a>"]
