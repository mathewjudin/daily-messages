<b>It is perfectly ok to be stuck</b> At this stage, it is perfectly normal to be stuck at supposedly simple steps! Different people get stuck at different places. Maybe you are stuck at an install when the other interns are not. All this is expected. When you do get stuck, just ask on the common channel and one of us will try to help you.
<b>The first month will be slow</b> Your first month with Qxf2 will simultaneously seem hard and unproductive. This is primarily happening because you are doing two things at once - picking up a lot of new vocabulary/concepts while also shaking off rust from your break. That is a killer combo but something you should accept and live with.
<b>Do not bother about where the internship is headed</b> For the duration of this internship, do not worry about where things are headed. Just see it as short-term investment of four months of your time and leave it at that. The way we teach things will seem highly inefficient and unconventional. It will also seem like it prevents you from truly mastering any single topic. We do this intentionally to help you discover your problem solving style. The payoff for this approach takes several weeks. So make sure you stick to the program.
<b>Focus on the trend also</b> A natural way to measure progress is against an end goal. During this internship, please remember to also adopt a view of measuring your progress against your starting point. This helps you combat any unrealistic expectations you might have for yourself based on hearsay or looking at others.
<b>Show up to work every day</b> Our biggest fear for this batch of interns is that you might quit. People with options tend to do that especially when the payoff for a hard task is not apparent. Do not do that. Instead, show up every single day. That includes the days you have not completed your work or the n-th day in a row that you are stuck on the same problem and have no solution. In return, all your Qxf2 colleagues will be as non-judemental as possible.
<b>The learning pattern</b> We switch the order of doing and gaining knowledge. In schools, you are first taught a base of knowledge and then asked to apply it. At Qxf2, we switch the order. We try to make you do stuff first and then have you learn it. This is highly uncomfortable for adults but bear with us. We know that the drawback of this method is that you end up being usure if you learnt anything at all! On the positive side, this is the right way of learning on the job. No matter what your next job is, the habit of trying something out and then learning about it will benefit you.
<b>Make friends with loose ends</b> If you spend a few weeks with us and do what we ask, you will have sense of incompleteness. A sense that there are a overwhelming number of loose ends for you to follow upon and learn thoroughly. Do not worry. In this internship, we will revisit the same topic multiple times. You do not need to master any topic on your first interaction. Think of the process as creating an intricate painting. At the initial stage, we are just getting you to pencil the outline lightly. Then, gradually over time, you will get several chances to fill in the details.
<b>Asking questions is hard</b> Asking technical questions over chat is hard but it is an essential skill you should try to get better at. I don't have tips for this (Im a bot :P), but I wanted to let you know that we get your pain. Maybe the next time you meet with a Qxf2 colleague, ask them for tips on how to get better at this skill.
<b>Pace is a tricky thing</b> At this stage of your learning, decouple pace and output. Going slow is not a sign you are doing poorly. Finishing early is not a sign you are doing good. Sometimes we get stuck on the most basic things while more complex stuff just clicks into place  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<b>Your progress will not be linear</b> Please expect your progress to be non-linear. You might struggle for weeks to understand how to write a simple script. And then, in one week, suddenly belt out several useful scripts. There seems to be a certain threshold of trying, doing and struggling that is needed before things click into place. We do not know why this happens but we have seen this with trainee after trainee. So keep at it and hopefully things will suddenly improve.
